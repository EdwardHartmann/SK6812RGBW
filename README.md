# SK6812RGBW
STM32 Library for SK6812 RGBW led strings

This Library is a modification of Roger Clark's WS2812B_STM32_Libmaple library.

Please read Roger's readme about the design of his library for more technical details.
https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/WS2812B_STM32_Libmaple/blob/master/README.md


This library only supports LED strips with timing characteristics similar to the WS2812 or SK6812 that support the 4 byte RGBW data protocol.
